Inflammatory breast cancer is permitted.\\nAll confirmed invasive disease must have been tested for ER, PR, and HER2 and participants must have hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (ER>1% or PR>1%, AND HER2-negative per ASCO CAP guidelines, 2013).\\nParticipants with multicentric, multifocal, and/or contralateral cancers are allowed as long as one lesion meets eligibility and no biopsied tumor is HER2+.\\nPrior systemic therapy: No prior chemotherapy, biologic therapy, hormonal therapy or investigational therapy for this operable breast cancer.\\nPrior radiation therapy: No prior radiation to the ipsilateral breast.\\nThe participant is ≥18 years old\\nThe participant has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 (see Appendix A)\\n\\nParticipants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count ≥1500/mm3\\nPlatelets ≥100,000/mm3\\nHemoglobin ≥9 g/dL\\nTotal Bilirubin ≤1.5 mg/dL (< 2.0 in participants with known Gilbert's syndrome)\\nSerum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL OR calculated GFR ≥60mL/min\\nAlanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.\\nInternational normalized ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) <1.5 times the upper limit of normal unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\\nActivated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) <1.5 times the upper limit of normal unless subject is receiving anticoagulant therapy, as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of intended use of anticoagulants.\\nThe participant is capable of understanding and complying with the protocol and has signed the informed consent document.\\nThe participant must be willing to undergo the three required research biopsies over the course of protocol therapy. Participants who undergo an attempted research biopsy procedure for the purpose of this protocol, and in whom inadequate tissue is obtained, are not required to undergo a repeat biopsy in order to continue on protocol.\\nThe effects of pembrolizumab on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, both women and men of child-bearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (Section 5.5.2) starting with the first dose of study therapy and for the duration of study participation, through 120 days after the last dose of study medication.\\n\\nNote: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. While on the study, women may not breast-feed. Women of childbearing potential are defined as those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not been free from menses for > 1 year.\\n\\nFemale subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication. If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will be required.\\nParticipants on bisphosphonates may continue receiving bisphosphonate therapy during study treatment.\\nExclusion Criteria: The participant has received prior pembrolizumab or any other anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 therapy, or has participated in any prior studies involving pembrolizumab\\nHypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.\\nThe participant has any history or evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease.\\nThe participant has an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable angina pectoris, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III or IV; see Appendix B), active ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction within the previous six months, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, chronic liver or renal disease, or severe malnutrition.\\nConcurrent use of potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (see Appendix C), such as ketoconazole and erythromycin, should be avoided during the study treatment with nab-paclitaxel.\\nPregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab has the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab.\\nActive infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at week 1 day 1.\\nIndividuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Participants with other cancers diagnosed within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed with the study sponsor to determine eligibility.\\nThe participant has a medical condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive medication including disease modifying agents, or has required such therapy in the last 2 years. Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.\\nThe participant has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents.\\nThe participant is known to be positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen, or Hepatitis C RNA. Testing for screening is not required.\\nKnown HIV-positive participants.HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with pembrolizumab.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.\\nSerum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.\\nUrine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.\\nAll patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease.

(MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry.

If pathologic examination demonstrates tumor at the line of resection, additional operative procedures may be performed to obtain clear margins. If tumor is still present at the resected margin after re-excision(s), the patient must undergo total mastectomy to be eligible. (Patients with margins positive for LCIS are eligible without additional resection.)\\nFor patients who undergo mastectomy, margins must be free of gross residual tumor. Patients with microscopic positive margins are eligible.\\n\\nConditions for patient eligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nThe patient must have consented to participate and must have signed and dated an IRB-approved consent form that conforms to federal and institutional guidelines.\\nPatients must be female.\\nThe patient must be greater than or equal to 18 years old.\\nThe patient's ECOG performance status must be 0 or 1.\\nThe tumor must be invasive adenocarcinoma of the breast on histologic examination.\\nThe breast cancer must be determined to be HER2-positive prior to study entry. Assays performed using FISH require gene amplification. Assays using IHC require a strongly positive (3+) staining score.\\n\\nAt the time of study entry, blood counts must meet the following criteria:\\n\\nAbsolute neutrophil count (ANC) must be greater than/equal to 1200/mm3.\\nPlatelet count must be greater than/equal to 100,000/mm3.\\nHemoglobin must be greater than/equal to 10 g/dL.\\n\\nThe following criteria for evidence of adequate hepatic function must be met:\\n\\ntotal bilirubin must be less than/equal to ULN for the lab unless the patient has a grade 1 bilirubin elevation (greater than ULN to 1.5 x ULN) due to Gilbert's disease or similar syndrome involving slow conjugation of bilirubin; and\\nalkaline phosphatase must be less than 2.5 x ULN for the lab; and\\nAST must be less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN for the lab.\\nAlkaline phosphatase and AST may not both be greater than the ULN. For example, if the alkaline phosphatase is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN, then the AST must be less than/equal to the ULN. If the AST is greater than the ULN but less than/equal to 1.5 x ULN, then the alkaline phosphatase must be less than/equal to ULN.\\nPatients with AST or alkaline phosphatase greater than ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if liver imaging (CT, MRI, or PET scan) does not demonstrate metastatic disease, and has adequate hepatic function.\\nPatients with either skeletal pain or alkaline phosphatase that is greater than ULN but less than/equal to 2.5 x ULN are eligible for inclusion in the study if a bone scan or PET scan does not demonstrate metastatic disease. Patients with suspicious findings on bone scan or PET scan are eligible if suspicious findings are confirmed as benign by x-ray, MRI, or biopsy.\\nSerum creatinine less than/equal to ULN for the lab.\\nUrine protein/creatinine (UPC) ratio must be less than 1.0.\\nAll patients must have their LVEF assessed by 2-D echocardiogram within 3 months prior to study entry. (MUGA scan may be substituted for 2-D echocardiogram based on institutional preferences.) The LVEF must be greater than/equal to 55% regardless of the institution's LLN.\\nNote: Since the pre-entry LVEF serves as the baseline for comparing subsequent LVEF assessments to determine if trastuzumab and bevacizumab therapy can be administered, it is critical that this baseline study be an accurate assessment of the patient's LVEF. If the baseline LVEF is greater than 65%, the investigator is encouraged to have the accuracy of the initial LVEF result confirmed and to consider repeating the study if the accuracy is uncertain.\\nExclusion Criteria: Conditions for patient ineligibility (Cohort A)\\n\\nFNA alone to diagnose the primary tumor.\\nSurgical axillary staging procedure prior to study entry. (Procedures that are permitted include: 1) FNA or core biopsy of an axillary node for any patient, and 2) although not recommended, a pre-neoadjuvant therapy SN biopsy for patients with clinically negative axillary nodes.\\n\\nCondition for patient ineligibility (Cohort B)\\n\\n• Breast reconstruction using tissue expanders or implants at the time of mastectomy.\\n\\nConditions for patient ineligibility (ALL patients)\\n\\nDefinitive clinical or radiologic evidence of metastatic disease.\\nSynchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer.\\nHistory of ipsilateral or contralateral invasive breast cancer regardless of treatment or ipsilateral DCIS treated with RT.\\nHistory of non-breast malignancies within the 5 years prior to study entry. Patients with the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the previous 5 years: carcinoma in situ of the cervix, carcinoma in situ of the colon, melanoma in situ, and basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\\nPrior therapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, trastuzumab, or bevacizumab for any malignancy.\\nTreatment including RT, chemotherapy, and/or targeted therapy, administered for the currently diagnosed breast cancer prior to study entry.\\nContinued therapy with any hormonal agent such as raloxifene, tamoxifen, or other SERM. (Patients are eligible if these medications are discontinued prior to study entry.)\\nAny sex hormonal therapy, e.g., birth control pills, ovarian hormone replacement therapy, etc. These patients are eligible if this therapy is discontinued prior to study entry. (Women of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective non-hormonal method of contraception during study therapy and for at least 6 months after completion of targeted therapy.)\\n\\nCardiac disease that would preclude the use of the drugs included in the FB-5 treatment regimen. This includes but is not confined to:\\n\\nActive cardiac disease: angina pectoris that requires the use of anti-anginal medication; ventricular arrhythmias except for benign premature ventricular contractions controlled by medication; supraventricular and nodal arrhythmias requiring a pacemaker or not controlled with medication; conduction abnormality requiring a pacemaker; and clinically significant valvular disease.\\nHistory of cardiac disease: myocardial infarction documented by elevated cardiac enzymes or persistent regional wall abnormalities on assessment of LV function; documented CHF; or documented cardiomyopathy.\\nUncontrolled hypertension defined as systolic BP greater than 150 mmHg or diastolic BP greater han 90 mmHg, with or without anti-hypertensive medication.
